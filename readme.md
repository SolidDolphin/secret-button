## Overview

Has your wife or girlfriend ever said you’re not romantic?
This project exists to prove that claim wrong, with code.

This valentine request is a just a small, playful web page. When the user moves the cursor close, the button flees across the screen, refusing to be clicked.
What looks like a simple “yes or no” choice turns into a short chase.

The implementation is simple. plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a moment that feels personal and fun. No backend. No data collection. Just 2 pages, a clever trick, and a shared laugh.
